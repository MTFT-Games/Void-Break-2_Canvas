			<p>
				Void Break is an arcade style game based heavily off of Asteroids with some
				inspiration from Nova Drift and Bosconian. It's built in JavaScript with
				Canvas for graphics and Howler for sound effects.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game plays very similar to Asteroids in the basic concepts and objective
				but varies in several ways. The first of which is the movement style, where
				in Asteroids there is no friction whatsoever, here there is a good bit of
				friction. This produces a very floaty movement system that is a bit more
				comfortable to control while still placing emphasis on the movement and
				thinking a step ahead of where the character is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another deviation is the camera and world. In both Asteroids and Nova Drift
				the world is confined to the edges of the view and upon hitting the edge,
				the character is warped to the other side. In Void Break, the world is
				much larger with the camera staying centered on the player but it still
				keeps the ability to wrap around the world seamlessly by using a looping
				background and showing the other side of the world over the edges.
			</p>
			<p>
				The health system uses a shield and health bar instead of lives and the
				shield starts to replenish after several seconds of not taking damage.
			</p>
			<p>
				The asteroids are spawned with a size and frequency dependant on the
				current score and the number of asteroids already in existence. The
				shape is randomly generated for each asteroid and velocity as well
				as initial placement are random. Upon breaking an asteroid, it will
				fragment into others if it is large enough and increment the score.
