# Void-Break
A game along the lines of Nova drift meets Bosconian. The concept of asteroids but with modern and roguelike elements from Nova Drift, plus the twist of a much larger wrapping playspace, scrolling camera style, and static objectives of Bosconian. 

Written in JavaScript, originally using PixiJS, now being converted to Canvas. Built as a class project, develoment is ongoing here but will likely be converted to monogame in the future for devcade.
