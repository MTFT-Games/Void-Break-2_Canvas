# Void-Break_PixiJS
An in progress project to create a game along the lines of Nova drift meets Bosconian. The concept of asteroids but with modern and roguelike elements from Nova Drift, plus the twist of a much larger wrapping playspace, scrolling camera style, and static objectives of Bosconian. 
Written in JavaScript using PixiJS. Originally started as a class project but planned to be expanded and built upon.
